With the help of salt, Sakura was able to seal the card away, and none of our cakes were too sweet this time!","publishedDate":"17 Nov. 1998","rating":{"count":50,"star":7}},{"idx":30,"no":"S1, Ep30","title":"Sakura and the Injured Card","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/IMDb/spinning-progress.gif","image_large":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/IMDb/spinning-progress.gif","plot":"Sakura tried to seal the Dash card, but it escaped into someone's yard, and some lady said the battle costume I made for Sakura looked strange.
